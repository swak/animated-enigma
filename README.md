**Using Emotion & Tailwind**

With the CSS utility library Tailwind you can quickly add styles and responsive design, all without having to write any css. Emotion allows you to name and style elements within your js files.

```JSX
/*
  import tw, { styled } from 'twin.macro';

  ** Creating a styled div, centering children via flex-box **
*/

const StyledDiv = styled.div`
  ${tw`flex justify-center items-center`}
`

const AltStyledDiv = tw.div`flex justify-center items-center`

return (
 <>
    <StyledDiv>
      <p>I'm centred</p>
      <p>Me too!</p>
    </StyledDiv>
    <AltStyledDiv>
      <p>Same here</p>
    </AltStyledDiv>
 </>
);
```

The [tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com) are a great resource to get you started. The starter uses [twin.macro](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro) which also has some additional helpful utilities.

**Customisation**

- [Tailwind config](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration). Open up the `tailwind.config.js` file to set your own project preferences & requirements, such as break-points, colours, and fonts.

- A layout component (`src/components/elements/layout.js`) is used for setting a standardised default layout.

- This template uses the plugin [typefaces](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typefaces/blob/master/README.md) to optimise font delivery. Changing font(s) simply requires installing your favourite typeface-font and importing into `gatsby-browser.js`. Remember to add your font(s) into `tailwind.config.js`, either the fonts sans/serif array, in order to use it with tailwind utilities.

- SEO component, taken from [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog), allowing you to add your SEO descriptions & title's.

- Favicon. Auto-generated from [gatsby-plugin-manifest](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-manifest#readme) set in `gatsby-config.js`. Replace the current favicon (`src/images/icon/logo.png`) with your own 512x512 icon

- Analytics. Add your google analytics id via an .env file `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS` to get started.
